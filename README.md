# Frontend Mentor - Fylo Data Storage Component Solution

This is my solution to the Fylo Data Storage Component challenge on Frontend Mentor. This challenge allowed me to practice building a responsive UI component using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques while closely following a provided design.

## Overview
This project is a responsive data storage component that displays how much storage has been used and how much is left. The component adapts to different screen sizes and includes a customized progress bar, decorative elements, and a clean, modern UI inspired by the original Fylo design.

The goal was to replicate the design as accurately as possible while keeping the code clean, readable, and maintainable.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size.
- See a visual representation of storage usage using a progress bar.
- Clearly read storage information on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Experience a layout that closely matches the original design provided by Frontend Mentor.

## My process
- Structured the layout using **semantic HTML5** elements.
- Used **Flexbox** to align and distribute content within the main components.
- Styled the project using **CSS custom properties (variables)** to maintain a consistent color palette and reuse gradients.
- Customized the native `<progress>` element to match the design, including browser-specific styling.
- Applied **absolute positioning** for decorative elements like the storage indicator and triangle shape.
- Implemented **responsive design** using media queries to adapt the layout for desktop and mobile screens.
- Followed the **BEM methodology** for class naming to keep the CSS organized and scalable.

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Responsive design principles
- BEM naming methodology

## What I learned
- How to customize native HTML elements like `<progress>` for a polished UI.
- Managing layouts with **Flexbox** while keeping components modular and reusable.
- Using **CSS variables** effectively for colors, gradients, and theme consistency.
- Creating decorative UI elements using pure CSS (`border-radius`, `clip-path`, `position`).
- Improving responsive layouts through media queries and adaptive positioning.
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable CSS by following **BEM conventions**.
